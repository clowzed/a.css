# a.css

## What
This a simple `classless` css framework for making your website look a bit nicer.

I wrote it for myself for simple pages describing something. It `was not made to be responsive` and `does not cover all tags` but still makes simple page look beautiful.

## Requirements
- Installed `PT Mono` font

## Installation
Past this to your html page 
```html
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "">
```

## TODO
- [ ] Cover all tags
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Prettify tables
